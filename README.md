# <a id="edreams_challenge_0"></a>Simple React app for search itineraries.

I created this project with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/). I used React because it provides a very good way to have an SPA.

I have used [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) instead of classes in order to have a more readable and scalable code.

I have used [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) to routing the React SPA.

I have used [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) to style the components.

## Available Scripts

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
