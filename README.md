# <a id="edreams_challenge_0"></a>Simple React app for search itineraries.

I created this project with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/). I used React because it provides a very good way to have an SPA.

I have used [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) instead of classes in order to have a more readable and scalable code.

I have used [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) to routing the React SPA.

I have used [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) to style the components.

I have used [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/25.x/tutorial-react) and [Enzime](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/) for unit testing of the components.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
